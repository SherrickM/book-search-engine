## Acceptance Criteria 

### Back-End Specifications

Youâ€™ll need to complete the following tasks in each of these back-end files:

* `auth.js`: Update the auth middleware function to work with the GraphQL API.

* `server.js`: Implement the Apollo Server and apply it to the Express server as middleware.

* `Schemas` directory:

	* `index.js`: Export your typeDefs and resolvers.

	* `resolvers.js`: Define the query and mutation functionality to work with the Mongoose models.

		**Hint**: Use the functionality in the `user-controller.js` as a guide.

	* `typeDefs.js`: Define the necessary `Query` and `Mutation` types:

		* `Query` type:

			* `me`: Which returns a `User` type.
		
		* `Mutation` type:

			* `login`: Accepts an email and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `addUser`: Accepts a username, email, and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `saveBook`: Accepts a book author's array, description, title, bookId, image, and link as parameters; returns a `User` type. (Look into creating what's known as an `input` type to handle all of these parameters!)

			* `removeBook`: Accepts a book's `bookId` as a parameter; returns a `User` type.
			
		* `User` type:

			* `_id`

			* `username`

			* `email`

			* `bookCount`

			* `savedBooks` (This will be an array of the `Book` type.)

		* `Book` type:

			* `bookId` (Not the `_id`, but the book's `id` value returned from Google's Book API.)

			* `authors` (An array of strings, as there may be more than one author.)

			* `description`

			* `title`

			* `image`

			* `link`

		* `Auth` type:

			* `token`

			* `user` (References the `User` type.)
